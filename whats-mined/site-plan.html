    <h2 class="section-title">What is crypto mining?</h2>
    <p class="info">When people say mining the first thing that comes to mind is a pickaxe and maybe a hard had and soot covered faces. While 
        crypto mining may no require high level of physical activity, it does take a bit of know how and some equipment. So what is mining? 
        mining is the way that new crypto is relased onto the block chain. There are two ways that it typically takes place. One proof of work is when 
        transactions are verifies by a mathmaticl algorithm that computers races to solve. Each participating computer, often referred to as a “miner,” 
        solves a mathematical problem that helps verify a group of transactions—referred to as a block—then adds them to the blockchain ledger. 
        The first computer to do so successfully is rewarded with a small amount of cryptocurrency for its efforts. Usually porcessing power is pooled between many computers and the 
        rewards are spilt in that pool. The faster a computer solves a porblem the more rewards it can receive, so naturally people tend to use graphics cards
        that have high processing power, but the higher the processing power the more heat is produced and the more energy is required to cool down and maintain the computer.
        Some miners may barely break even after poer cost and computing resuource value is taken into account. Another method of verifcation is Proof-of-stake whichreduces the amount of 
        power used in the verification of transactions by limiting the amount of transactions you can verify by
        how much you are willing to 'stake' or lockup. In either case mining can be costly to start. Be it through requiring poewrfull computers 
        and high energy cost, or through then of high starting capitol to make your staked amount big enough, and deciding if mining is a 
        feasible path of investment for you should take careful financial planning and plentiful research.

            <p class="info">Crypto currencies are a digital, encrypted, and decentraliezed assest. It can be used to buy goods and services, but most people use it as an ivestment,
                trading it and exchanging it for Fiat currencies at highs and lows, or even exchagnging it for other assets. In general Crypto currencies as an ivestment is seena volitile due to 
                the lack of a central authority that would maintain the value of the currency, but there are many different types of crypto that are design to be stable and tied to teh value of fiat currencies.
                While there are a number of goods and services that you can buy with crypto, particularly with Litecoin, Bitcoin or Ethereum, you may also use crypto as an alternative investment option outside of stocks and bonds.
                Using crypto to make purchases securely depends on what you're trying to buy.If you're trying to make a payment in cryptocurrency, you'll most likely need a cryptocurrency wallet. One type of wallet is a 
                'metamask wallet' a software program that interacts with the blockchain and allows users to send and receive their stored cryptocurrency. There are also wallets that are maintained by centralized exchanges such as, coin base, which allows easy 
                conversion from fiat currecies to crypto-currencies. Remember that transactions are not instantaneous as they must be validated by some form of mechanism depending on the currency.
                transaction are validated by 'miners' that recieve crytpo dpending of the amount of processing power provided to the 
                block chain.
