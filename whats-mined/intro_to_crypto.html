            <p class="info">Crypto currencies are a digital, encrypted, and decentraliezed assest. It can be used to buy goods and services, but most people use it as an ivestment,
                trading it and exchanging it for Fiat currencies at highs and lows, or even exchagnging it for other assets. In general Crypto currencies as an ivestment is seena volitile due to 
                the lack of a central authority that would maintain the value of the currency, but there are many different types of crypto that are design to be stable and tied to teh value of fiat currencies.
                While there are a number of goods and services that you can buy with crypto, particularly with Litecoin, Bitcoin or Ethereum, you may also use crypto as an alternative investment option outside of stocks and bonds.
                Using crypto to make purchases securely depends on what you're trying to buy.If you're trying to make a payment in cryptocurrency, you'll most likely need a cryptocurrency wallet. One type of wallet is a 
                'metamask wallet' a software program that interacts with the blockchain and allows users to send and receive their stored cryptocurrency. There are also wallets that are maintained by centralized exchanges such as, coin base, which allows easy 
                conversion from fiat currecies to crypto-currencies. Remember that transactions are not instantaneous as they must be validated by some form of mechanism depending on the currency.
                transaction are validated by 'miners' that recieve crytpo dpending of the amount of processing power provided to the 
                block chain.
