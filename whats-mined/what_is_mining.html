                <h2 class="section-title">What is crypto mining?</h2>
                <p class="info">When people say mining the first thing that comes to mind is a pickaxe and maybe a hard had and soot covered faces. While 
                    crypto mining may no require high level of physical activity, it does take a bit of know how and some equipment. So what is mining? 
                    mining is the way that new crypto is relased onto the block chain. There are two ways that it typically takes place. One proof of work is when 
                    transactions are verifies by a mathmaticl algorithm that computers races to solve. Each participating computer, often referred to as a “miner,” 
                    solves a mathematical problem that helps verify a group of transactions—referred to as a block—then adds them to the blockchain ledger. 
                    The first computer to do so successfully is rewarded with a small amount of cryptocurrency for its efforts. Usually porcessing power is pooled between many computers and the 
                    rewards are spilt in that pool. The faster a computer solves a porblem the more rewards it can receive, so naturally people tend to use graphics cards
                    that have high processing power, but the higher the processing power the more heat is produced and the more energy is required to cool down and maintain the computer.
                    Some miners may barely break even after poer cost and computing resuource value is taken into account. Another method of verifcation is Proof-of-stake whichreduces the amount of 
                    power used in the verification of transactions by limiting the amount of transactions you can verify by
                    how much you are willing to 'stake' or lockup. In either case mining can be costly to start. Be it through requiring poewrfull computers 
                    and high energy cost, or through then of high starting capitol to make your staked amount big enough, and deciding if mining is a 
                    feasible path of investment for you should take careful financial planning and plentiful research.
